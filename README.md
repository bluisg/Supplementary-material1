## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents  

### CSV Files (Initial or Raw Data)  
- **Deposition.csv**
River deposition data (ha/year) in different sections and analysis periods.  

- **Erosion.csv**  
  River erosion data (ha/year), used to assess soil loss processes associated with mining.  

- **Migration.csv**  
  Records of lateral channel migration (m/year), showing how the river has changed its course over time.  

- **Morphometric Parameters.csv**
General geomorphological variables of the sections analyzed, including average width, sinuosity, wavelength, and semimeander length.

These files represent the **raw data** obtained from satellite image processing and spatial analysis.

### Word document (Supplementary information) 
The Word file includes: 
- **Tables with final data** on erosion, deposition, migration, and morphometric parameters.
- A **comparative graph of erosion and deposition**, classified by subperiods, which facilitates the visualization of temporal trends.
- A **catalog of Landsat satellite images** used in the research, indicating the years and scenes used in the multitemporal analysis.
